#Problem 7: Best Book
'''Imagine you are working on a book review software like
 Goodreads. Write a function named highest_rated() that 
 returns the book with the highest rating.

The function should take in a list of dictionaries named 
books as a parameter. Each dictionary represents data 
associated with a book, including its title, author, and 
rating. The function should return the dictionary for the 
book with the highest rating.

def highest_rated(books):
    pass
Example Input:

books = [
    {"title": "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow",
     "author": "Gabrielle Zevin",
     "rating": 4.18
    },
    {"title": "A Fortune For Your Disaster",
     "author": "Hanif Abdurraqib",
     "rating": 4.47
    },
    {"title": "The Seven Husbands of Evenlyn Hugo",
     "author": "Taylor Jenkins Reid",
     "rating": 4.40
    }
]
Expected Output:

{"title": "A Fortune For Your Disaster",
 "author": "Hanif Abdurraqib",
 "rating": 4.47
}'''
