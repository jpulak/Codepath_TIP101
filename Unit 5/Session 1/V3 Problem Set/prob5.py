#Problem 5: Add Special Item
'''Players can pick up special items as they race.

Update the Player class with a new method add_item() that takes in one parameter, item_name.

The method should validate the item_name.

If the item is valid, add item_name to the player’s items attribute.
The method does not need to return any values.
item_name is valid if it has one of the following values: "banana", "green shell", "red shell", "bob-omb", "super star", "lightning", "bullet bill".

class Player():
	def  __init__(self, character, kart):
		self.character = character
		self.kart = kart
		self.items = []
		
	def add_item(self, item_name):
		pass
Example Usage:

player_one = Player("Yoshi", "Dolphin Dasher")
# items = []

player_one.add_item("red shell")
# items = ["red shell"]

player_one.add_item("super star")
# items = ["red shell", "super star"]

player_one.add_item("super smash")
# items = ["red shell", "super star"]'''
