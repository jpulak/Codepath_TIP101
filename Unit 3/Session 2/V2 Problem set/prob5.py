#Problem 5: Partition Labels
'''Write a function partition_labels() that takes in a 
string s as a parameter. s consists of lowercase letters 
and represents the order of characters as they appear in a
 document. The function partitions s into as many parts as
   possible so that each unique letter appears in at most 
   one part, and returns a list of integers representing 
   the size of these parts.

def partition_label(s):
    pass
Example Usage:

s1 = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
print(partition_label(s1))

s2 = "abcabcbadefffeda"
print(partition_label(s2))
Example Output:

# s1 partitioned into "ababcbaca", "defegde" and "hijhklij"
[9, 7, 8]
# s2 cannot be partitioned into more parts because of the 
# "a" character at the end
[16]
